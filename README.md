# Polynomial-Interpolation (all the exercise was solved using Python)


It was given a table with the values of the body's position according to time. Using this information, I calculated the coefficients of the polynomials Px(t), Py(t) and Pz(t) 
using the polynomial interpolation method. 
Then, it was asked to calculate the position of the body according to different values of time, where t = j/50, where j = 0, 1, 2,..., 50.
I also calculated the sums of the three polynomials according to time, which were close to 1.
At the end, I used the library matplotlib to plot the graph in a 3D perspective.
